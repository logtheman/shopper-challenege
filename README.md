PRIORTIES:
- Clean interface that is welcoming
- Responsive form that politely warns the applicant when incorrect data entered
- Responsive signals to move forward
- Fast and responsive. Demonstrate client side handling.

DIFFICULTIES:
- Spent too much time styling and being concerned with the footer
- Sessions and editing the applicant
- Design solution with a separation between client and api. This caused difficulties that would have been easily solved by using built in rails functionality.

GIVEN MORE TIME
- Would create a more secure login to the user application
- Add additional steps in the process (confirm over 21, etc...)
- Create system for tracking step in the application process
  - Initially took on the task without planning how the user flow would be in state
- Create a more generalized system for changing form components and make info a list
- Hydrate from the database for client side real-time checking of email avaliablity
